# ArtComissions
MVC Practice Project

## What it does:
This project can register/sign up commissions from users that are later displayed in a list tab, where artists can look at commissions that sound interesting to them and approach the clients, instead of the other way around.

## What's the purpose of the project:
This is not meant to be a serious project, this is exam practice. A lot of the feature implementation may have been skipped over with the purposes of practicing some other functionallity. This project is by all means: not finished.
